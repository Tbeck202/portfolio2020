                    Originally from Salt Lake City, Utah, I am a software developer living in beautiful Portland, Oregon. I have dedicated the past year to learning and improving my skills by attending two separate developer bootcamps. I attended the Tech Academy here in Portland over the summer of 2019 and upon completion, I attended and completed the web developer bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy. I've grown and learned so much over the last year and I can't wait to see where I go from here as I continue to grow as a developer.

                <p>
                    As a professional, I believe in hard work and continued education. Furthermore, I believe that I have a responsibilty to keep learning and growing throughout my career so that I can always make a meaningful impact in any setting.

                            <p>Here's an interesting project! This was actually part of a code along in a bootcamp but I just thought it was too cool to hide. In this project, I learned how to work with Javascript libraries and also about the canvas HTML tag. The site is a clone of a site called patatap and is pretty fun to play around with. Upon pressing any lettered key on your keyboard, a sound is played and an animation is displayed.</p>

                                <p>This here is actually the very first portfolio worthy project I ever completed.  It is a simple app that takes in some user input and calculates the total cost of a mock pizza deliver order.  Built with plain old HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, this was the first application I built with any real substance and I'm still proud of it to this day.</p>
